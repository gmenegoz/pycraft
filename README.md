# Getting Started
## Dependencies
### Install Python
First of all, let’s install Python 2.7 on our computer! You can find it at: https://www.python.org/downloads/
 
### Install Java JDK
You will also need to install the Java Runtime Environment, to be able to launch the Spigot server. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system: https://java.com/it/download/manual.jsp

## Pycraft server
### Download Pycraft folder
After installing Python and Java, you can download this repository (master branch). Now, extract the zip archive contents and open the Pycraft folder.

### Launch the server
Execute the "launcher.py" file. It will launch a Spigot server locally, on your computer, to which we would then connect to Minecraft so that our projects in Python can be run within the game. In order for a python script can communicate with a game of Minecraft, it is in fact your computer must be running the server.

## Minecraft
Now open Minecraft.

First we have to create a new profile to suit the Minecraft server that will be used by clicking on "NewProfile" and selecting "UseVersion: 1.10.2". For convenience we can call this profile "pycraft". Remember to select it each time you want to use pycraft.

Now we are ready to begin!
Let’s start the server by double-clicking the file that corresponds to your operating system.
Once you launched Minecraft, choose "multiplayer" then "direct connect", typing "localhost" as address.
If you access the world of Minecraft it means that everything worked properly :) ...otherwise try to re-read the instructions above :(

## RECIPES
Now that the Pycraft environment is setted up you are ready to explore and play with Python in Minecraft.
