# Pycraft for Minecraft
![alt text](https://alessandronorfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/pycraft.png?w=136&h=150)

Modified, simplified and improved libraries to code in python via Minecraft

Based on the terrific idea and the original code of David Whale and Martin O'Hanlon (www.stuffaboutcode.com)

# Getting Started
## Dependencies 
### Python
Install Python 2.7: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install Pycraft library:
- pip install pycraft_minetest

### Java JDK
You will also need to install the Java Runtime Environment, to be able to launch the Spigot server. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system: https://java.com/it/download/manual.jsp

## Pycraft server
### Download Pycraft folder
After installing Python and Java, you can download this repository (master branch). Now, extract the zip archive contents and open the Pycraft folder.

### Launch the server
Execute the "launcher.py" file. It will launch a Spigot server locally, on your computer, to which we would then connect via Minecraft, so that our scripts in Python will be run within the game.

NOTE: In order for a python script to communicate with the Minecraft world, the Pycraft server must always be up and running.

## Minecraft
Now open Minecraft.

First we have to create a new profile to suit the Minecraft server that will be used by clicking on "NewProfile" and selecting "UseVersion: 1.10.2". For convenience we can call this profile "pycraft". Remember to select it each time you want to use pycraft.

Now we are ready to begin!

### Connect to the Pycraft world
Once you launched Minecraft, choose "multiplayer" then "direct connect", typing "localhost" as address.
If you access the world of Minecraft it means that everything worked properly :) ...otherwise try to re-read the instructions above :(

### Execute Python scripts in Minecraft


### Setup an editor for Python
You can use your favourite Python IDE... anyway we suggest Pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). If you install Pycharm, we also suggest to import these settings:
* [WINDOWS or LINUX](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9leATA2g5JjT3V4RVNLNWpvNms)
* [MAC](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9leATA2g5JjQTBzSmdETmxCX1k)

So after the first execution, click on FILE -> Import settings and then select the downloaded settings file.

### Recipes
You can find some example script inside the [projects](https://github.com/gmenegoz/pycraft/tree/master/projects) folder.

### Documentation
Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/gmenegoz/pycraft/wiki) of this repository as library documentation.

Or you can read the full [getting started article](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1llSHBCEhkrPhav0oZjyfd_CUMyBJSw-M3nCBkghgGcQ).

### Scratch extension
